We’re pleased to introduce transportation facilities this academic year for a safe and convenient student commute. Buses cover major routes and are equipped with GPS, first-aid kits, and trained staff. A free van facility is also available (conditions apply). For details on routes, timings, and fees, please contact the school office.
