Inter-house events are an integral part of school life, promoting healthy competition, unity, and a strong sense of belonging among students. These events, which include sports, debates, quizzes, cultural performances, and more, encourage students to step out of their comfort zones and showcase their talents. Each house competes with enthusiasm and team spirit, aiming not just for victory but also for growth and learning. The inter-house system helps instill leadership, cooperation, and discipline, while also building friendships across different grades. It is heartening to see students supporting one another and taking pride in their house’s achievements. These events not only add excitement to the school year but also play a crucial role in the holistic development of our students.
