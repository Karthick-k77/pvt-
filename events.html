Inter-house events are an integral part of school life, promoting healthy competition, unity, and a strong sense of belonging among students. These events, which include sports, debates, quizzes, cultural performances, and more, encourage students to step out of their comfort zones and showcase their talents. Each house competes with enthusiasm and team spirit, aiming not just for victory but also for growth and learning. The inter-house system helps instill leadership, cooperation, and discipline, while also building friendships across different grades.

 A school exhibition is a wonderful platform for students to explore, innovate, and express their creativity across various subjects and themes. It provides an opportunity for learners to go beyond textbooks and showcase their understanding through models, experiments, charts, art, and interactive presentations. Whether it's science, art, literature, or social studies, the exhibition reflects the curiosity, hard work, and talent of our students. It also encourages teamwork, problem-solving, and confidence as students explain their projects to visitors. Parents, teachers, and guests witness the enthusiasm and potential of young minds, making the exhibition a truly enriching experience for everyone. Events like these highlight the importance of practical learning and foster a love for discovery and innovation in our school community.
