School academics lay the foundation for intellectual growth, focusing on core subjects like Math, Science, English, and Social Studies, while promoting conceptual clarity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Many schools now integrate competitive exam prep—such as for NTSE, Olympiads, JEE, NEET, and CUET—through in-school coaching or partnerships with reputed institutes. Starting from middle school, foundation courses, mock tests, and personalized support help students build skills for both academic success and future challenges.
